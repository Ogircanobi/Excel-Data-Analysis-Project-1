## Introduction

The bike sales data analysis project was designed to provide insights into customer demographics, sales trends, and other critical metrics. The project was divided into three main components:
- Data Cleaning
- Pivot Tables Creation
- Dashboard Development

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning was performed on a separate working sheet to ensure the integrity of the original data. The cleaning process involved:
- Removing duplicates
- Correcting inconsistencies
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing data formats

**Data Source:** `bike_buyers` sheet

## Pivot Tables

Several pivot tables were created to summarize and analyze the data from different perspectives. Key metrics and dimensions analyzed include:
- Average Income by Gender and Bike Purchase Status
- Total Sales by Region and Occupation
- Bike Purchase Rate by Age Bracket

**Data Source:** `Pivot Table` sheet

## Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was developed to present the findings in a visually appealing and easily interpretable format. The dashboard includes charts and graphs that highlight key insights from the data analysis.

**Data Source:** `Dashboard` sheet
